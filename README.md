# Hybrid_Plasma_module
In the folder modules you will find two python files. module1.py and module2.py. 
The first one (module1.py) is the file that run the code. Just run it in the terminal as python module1.py.
The second one (module2.py) is the file that contains the main functions. The principal function is time_evolution().
As you can see in module2.py, each function has comments to understand and follow the operations they execute.
