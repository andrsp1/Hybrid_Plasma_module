# Hybrid_Plasma_module
In the folder modules you will find two python files. module1.py and module2.py. 
The first one (module1.py) is the file that run the code. Just run it in the terminal as python module1.py.
module1.py contains a Class Hybrid_plasma that for an object only needs the number of particles.
The second one (module2.py) is the file that contains the main functions. The principal functions are time_evolution() and Sherlock_func().
As you can see in module2.py, each function has comments to understand and follow the operations they execute.

The code runs according to Sherlock's paper in which a brackgound electron fluid is considered (homogeneous plasma).
